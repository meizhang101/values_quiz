# Values Quiz

This is a tool that allows people to choose and rank their top 10 favorite values, but can also be applied to any set of items that the user wants ranked. 

To modify this to suit whatever items you would want to be ranked, you can edit the ```listOfValues``` at the very top of values-sort.js. Input your own key-value pairs as items (where key is the value that shows up on screen and value is the description that appears when hovering), and they are good to sort and rank.
