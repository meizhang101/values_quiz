# Values Quiz

This is a tool that allows people to choose and rank their top 10 favorite values, but can also be applied to any set of items that the user wants ranked. 
To modify this to suit whatever items you would want to be ranked, you can edit the values-sort.js. Edit the key value pairings within the listOfValues and input your own items with their corresponding description (leave blank for no description).
